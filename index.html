      <p id="tribute-info">Dr. Borlaug was born in Iowa in 1914. He earned a doctorate in plant pathology from the University of Minnesota in 1942. After the war, he worked in Mexico, where he developed high-yield wheat varieties that were resistant to disease. These varieties helped to increase wheat production in Mexico and other developing countries, and they are credited with saving millions of lives. Dr. Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his work. He died in 2009 at the age of 95.</p>
